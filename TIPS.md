So after my first study session I realized that:
  - It's fairly nerve wrecking to do the interview...
  1. I need to load the problem into my brain first
  2. Write out a high level approach to solving the problem
  3. THEN actually start thinking about methods to solve the problem
  4. The code really needs to work before I even start writing it

**It should be noted that the way the session goes having multiple people, some talking about the written test while others are doing coding limits my ability to ask questions.**
